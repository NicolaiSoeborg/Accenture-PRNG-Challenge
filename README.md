# Accenture (broken) RNG Challenge

Accenture had a nice challenge at the DSE fair at DTU 2017.

TODO: Desc. of challenge

Running this script will create random `z` (seed) and try to guess an input (`u`) that will produce the desired output (all cards `1`).

```
Spin 1 (u = [0, 0, 0, 0]).    Cards: [5|12|14|7]
Spin 2 (u = [6, 9, 13, 8]).   Cards: [5|5|11|14]
Spin 3 (u = [4, 7, 11, 5]).   Cards: [12|11|2|11]
Spin 4 (u = [0, 9, 1, 8]).    Cards: [4|6|14|3]
Spin 5 (u = [13, 1, 6, 7]).   Cards: [13|1|11|8]
Spin 6 (u = [1, 7, 2, 10]).   Cards: [12|6|1|5]
Spin 7 (u = [0, 6, 4, 10]).   Cards: [1|1|1|1]
Spin 8 (u = [4, 7, 11, 6]).   Cards: [1|1|1|1]
Spin 9 (u = [12, 1, 4, 9]).   Cards: [1|1|1|1]
Spin 10 (u = [5, 13, 0, 11]). Cards: [1|1|1|1]
```
